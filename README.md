# OwO-Connections

Connections are what make OwO come to life.  The Skill infrastructure has been designed to provide great power and flexibility for individual Skill development through Bizagi and API infrastructure, as well as supporting collaborative development.  Additionally, we aim to make discovery, installation and management of new Skills simple for stakeholders.
